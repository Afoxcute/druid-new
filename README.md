- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Reusable UI components

### Backend
- **tRPC**: End-to-end typesafe API
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database ORM
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Stellar SDK**: Integration with Stellar blockchain

### State Management
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Local Storage**: Persistence for session data

### Authentication & Security
- **Passkey Kit**: WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey implementation
- **bcryptjs**: Secure password hashing
- **Custom PIN verification**: 6-digit PIN security

## Technical Infrastructure

### API Structure
- **tRPC Routers**: Type-safe API endpoints
  - `/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`: API entry point
  - Routers for transfers, users, stellar operations

### Database Schema
- Users with wallet associations
- Transfers with transaction history
- Bills and payment records
- Currencies and exchange rates

### Blockchain Integration
- **Stellar Network**: For secure transactions
- **Soroban**: Smart contract platform
- **SACClient**: Stellar Asset Contract client

### Environment Configuration
- Type-safe environment variables via `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`
- Configuration for both server and client

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Authentication**: Sign up/in via email, phone, or passkey
2. **Wallet Creation**: Generate or connect to an existing wallet
3. **Fund Management**: View balance and transaction history
4. **Transfers**: Send money to recipients through various channels
5. **Bill Payments**: Pay bills securely with PIN verification

### Transfer Process
1. User initiates a transfer with recipient details
2. System generates a transfer record
3. User selects payment method (bank transfer, cash, etc.)
4. PIN verification ensures security
5. Transfer is executed and confirmed
6. Both sender and recipient get notifications

### Bill Payment Process
1. User selects bill type
2. Enters account information and amount
3. Verifies payment with PIN
4. System processes payment
5. Confirmation is provided to the user

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn package manager

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```

# With HTTPS (for testing WebAuthn/passkeys)
yarn dev:https
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Create a new migration
yarn db:generate

# Apply migrations
yarn db:migrate

# View database with Prisma Studio
yarn db:studio
```

## Production

```bash
# Build the application
yarn build
